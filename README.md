# HEScode

This code is created to create HES-code which simply is a code for each individual to go out or enter to public/private places.

* Person class contains name, last name, age, and HES code and is being inherited by all of the classes.
* If the person is below 20, they are considered kids and the kid class is being called.
* If the person is above 20 and below 65 they are considered parents and parent class is being called. Besides asking their names and ages, their kids' names and ages are asked using this class.
* If the person is above 65, they are considered elderly and the elderly class is being called.
* For each class of people, proper HES code is generated and printed out.
